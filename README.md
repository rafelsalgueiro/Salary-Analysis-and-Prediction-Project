# Salary Analysis and Prediction Project

This project aims to conduct exploratory data analysis and build predictive models to estimate employee salaries. Throughout the project, the following workflow will be followed:

1. **Dependencies**: List the necessary dependencies to run the project, including Python libraries and specific versions if needed.

2. **Load Data**: Load the necessary data for analysis and modeling.

3. **Define Functions**: Define the necessary functions to perform analysis and modeling.

4. **Data Analysis**: Carry out exploratory analysis of the data to understand its structure and characteristics.

5. **Preliminary Overview**: Provide an initial overview of the dataset.

6. **Complete, Correct, Create & Convert Data**: Take actions to complete, correct, create, and convert data as needed for analysis and modeling.

7. **Perform Exploratory Analysis with Graphics**: Conduct exploratory analysis using graphical visualizations to understand the relationships between variables, especially the relationship between salary and other relevant features.

8. **Work Year X Salary_in_USD Graphic**: Visualize the relationship between years of work and salary in US dollars.

9. **Experience Level X Salary_in_USD Graphic**: Visualize the relationship between experience level and salary in US dollars.

10. **Job Title X Salary_in_USD Graphic**: Visualize the relationship between job title and salary in US dollars.

11. **Job Category X Salary_in_USD Graphic**: Visualize the relationship between job category and salary in US dollars.

12. **Employee Residence X Salary_in_USD Graphic**: Visualize the relationship between employee residence and salary in US dollars.

13. **Remote Ratio X Salary_in_USD Graphic**: Visualize the relationship between remote work ratio and salary in US dollars.

14. **Company Size X Salary_in_USD Graphic**: Visualize the relationship between company size and salary in US dollars.

15. **Analyze Correlation Between Company Location and Employee Residence**: Analyze the correlation between company location and employee residence.

16. **Clean Data Visualization**: Create clean and clear visualizations to present the findings of the exploratory analysis.

17. **First Model (Linear Regression)**: Build a linear regression model to predict employee salaries.

18. **Second Model (Decision Tree)**: Build a decision tree model to predict employee salaries.

19. **Third Model (Random Forest)**: Build a random forest model to predict employee salaries.

20. **Data Augmentation**: Perform data augmentation, if necessary, to improve model performance.

21. **Third Model (Random Forest) with Synthetic Data**: Use synthetic data in the random forest model to assess its impact on predictions.

22. **Conclusion**: Provide a conclusion summarizing the findings of the analysis and modeling, as well as potential next steps.
